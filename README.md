# Installation
The easiest way to try `ytools` is to use the prebuilt binaries, that
are available at the [releases
page](https://github.com/codesoap/ytools/releases).

If you want to properly install `ytools` on your system, I recommend
building them yourself:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:codesoap/ytools.git
cd ytools

# Execute as root to install:
make install

# To uninstall use (again as root):
# make uninstall

# If you don't want to run make as root and don't care for the man
# page, you could alternatively run the following. This will install the
# binaries to ~/go/bin/:
# go install ./...
```

## Porcelain
You can find some convenient scripts in `porcelain/`. They are *not*
installed by `make install`. Place the ones you like in `$HOME/bin/`
(make sure this directory is in your `$PATH`).
